      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I study how the brain constructs and adapts space around the body. My research focuses on two interconnected lines of inquiry:

        **1. Plasticity of Peripersonal Space (PPS):**  
        I investigate how peripersonal spaceâ€”the space immediately surrounding the bodyâ€”can flexibly adapt to different contexts, tasks, and sensory feedback. A central theme in my work is comparing the plasticity of hand-centered and foot-centered PPS, revealing functional and neural distinctions between body parts in multisensory integration and action preparation.

        **2. Neural and Cognitive Architecture of Spatial Representations:**  
        I explore how the brain represents different spatial domainsâ€”peripersonal space, reaching space, and interpersonal spaceâ€”and how these spaces differ in their underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms. My work aims to clarify the functional boundaries and overlaps between these spatial systems, with implications for understanding social behavior, motor control, and sensory processing.

        I use immersive VR, behavioral experiments, and computational modeling to uncover the dynamic nature of space perception.
