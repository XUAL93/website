## About Me

I am a PhD Fellow at Ghent University, focusing on multisensory integration and human interaction in virtual environments. My academic career began at the University of Edinburgh, where I collaborated with Dr. Gherri on research exploring visuo-tactile perception and peripersonal space. Later, I was awarded a scholarship to join Prof. Talsma's team at Ghent University, where I continued investigating VR and spatial perception.
